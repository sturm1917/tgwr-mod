 # LAND DOCTRINES
 ww1_landdoctrine:0 "Cult of the Offensive"
 ww1_landdoctrine_desc:0 "The offensive capabilities of modern armies became so vast, the defense has proven to be almost obsolete. We must focus on concentrating all our efforts on the offensive, making the only viable method of defense a counter-attack. The élan vital of our soldiers is the key to winning a modern war."
 ww1_lead_by_order:0 "Lead by Order"
 ww1_lead_by_order_desc:0 "Tactical level of warfare is inseparable from the strategic level. Our supreme command has come up with strategic plans for military campaigns, while the job of junior officers is to obey their orders and convey them to their subordinates, making the army act as a single entity."
 ww1_lead_by_task:0 "Lead by Task"
 ww1_lead_by_task_desc:0 "Strategic level of warfare is inseparable from the tactical level. Our supreme command has come up with many brilliant plans, but not always their plans are consistent with the reality of the battlefield. Our junior officers, on the other hand, have more information to understand, how to achieve the task with minimal casualties, and we should encourage that."
 ww1_entrenchment:0 "Trench Warfare"
 ww1_entrenchment_desc:0 "The war didn't end as fast we expected, and in order to hold on to our newly conquered territories, we have to start fortifying our front lines. Building trenches will provide enough cover for our troops, while we'll be preparing a breakthrough to defeat the enemy."
 ww1_preliminary_bombardment:0 "Preliminary Bombardment"
 ww1_preliminary_bombardment_desc:0 "The best way to break through enemy lines is to kill enemy defenders with our heavy artillery. By conducting a preliminary bombardment, we'll be able to clear out enemy's trenches, so our infantry would capture them with the minimal casualties."
 ww1_infiltration:0 "Infiltration"
 ww1_infiltration_desc:0 "Sometimes, quality does supercede quantity. Instead of throwing our regular infantry in the wave attacks, we could train special units, equipped with our latest technology, to break through the enemy's weakest points in order to gain positional advantage."
 ww1_creeping_barrage:0 "Creeping Barrage"
 ww1_creeping_barrage_desc:0 "Instead of trying to bomb enemy army to the ground, we could use artillery to support our troops in their advance. By shelling no man's land with artillery in pace with the infantry, we can neutralize the enemy's ability to attack our men until the close combat becomes possible."
 ww1_bite_and_hold:0 "Bite and Hold"
 ww1_bite_and_hold_desc:0 "Instead of aiming for a decisive victory in a single offensive, we could launch a rather small-scale operation to bite into enemy lines and hold it with support of our artillery, making the enemy lose their men in countless counter-attacks."
 ww1_defence_in_depth:0 "Defence in Depth"
 ww1_defence_in_depth_desc:0 "Instead of concentrating our infantry on a single front line, always ready to attack, we will spread our defences on multiple lines, making enemy's flanks vulnerable for the counter-attacks of our mobile reserve and causing attrition to them."
 ww1_hurricane_bombardment:0 "Hurricane Bombardment"
 ww1_hurricane_bombardment_desc:0 "Instead of consecutively bombarding the enemy for several days we should focus on intense but short bombardments right before our offensive. Unlike preliminary bombardment or creeping barrage, hurricane bombardment, which targets enemy communications and cannons, disorganises the enemy and makes it hard for him to identify the exact moment of our attack."
 ww1_tank_support:0 "Armored Support"
 ww1_tank_support_desc:0 "We have developed a true technological monster. Tanks, tracked fortresses with cannons, can provide additional means of support for our infantry breakthrough because of their protection, which allows them to crush enemy's barbed-wire and machine gun nests, allowing the foot soldiers to step in safely."
 ww1_artillery_support:0 "Materialschlacht"
 ww1_artillery_support_desc:0 "Unfortunately, we failed to understand the value of some great technological advancements like armored cars or tanks on time. Being outnumbered in the new technology by enemy, we can make up for that by focusing on supplying our infantry with more submachine guns, steel helmets, grenades and artillery support. The better material will win the war, and our industry will provide it."
 ww1_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms"
 ww1_combined_arms_desc:0 "Tanks, gas and aviation have changed the face of modern war forever. With the new technologies and techniques developed to secure an edge over the enemy it had became clear, that attrition warfare is no longer a viable strategy to win this war. Instead, we will throw all arms at the enemy to secure the victory in a single offensive along the entire frontline."
 
 motorised_infantry2:0 "Motorised Infantry"
 motorised_infantry2_desc:0 "By extending the use of motor vehicles in infantry transports in the field, the mobility of otherwise slow-moving infantry units can be greatly improved, enabling faster responses and new strategies."
