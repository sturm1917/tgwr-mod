 ww1_germany.194.t:0 "Crisis stirs in Elsaß-Lothringen"
 ww1_germany.194.d:0 "Earlier this week, the twenty-year-old Second Lieutenant Günter Freiherr von Forstner of the Zabern garrison spoke disparagingly about the local inhabitants during a troop induction. The press reports that Forstner told his soldiers, 'If you are attacked, then make use of your weapon; if you stab such a Wackes in the process, then you'll get ten marks from me'. This event had been multiplied in severity by the media causing the local population to protest strongly against this treatment by the German military in the next few days."
 ww1_germany.194.oa:0 "It would be wise to keep an eye on this situation"
 ww1_germany.195.t:0 "Further troubles"
 ww1_germany.195.d:0 "The military court saw fit to give Forstner 7 days house arrest, which was later repealed at his second hearing. Unfortunately, unimpressed by these actions, the Alsatian public continued to protest. As a further provocation, Lieutenant Forstner was reported to go out and aggravate the public after having his punishment repealed. Soon after a huge crowd of people again assembled before the barracks, which led to what the military court has called an 'inappropriate counter-reaction of the troops.'"

 ww1_germany.196.t:0 "The Zabern Affair"
 ww1_germany.196.d:0 "Wilhelm II was hunting on the estate of Max Egon Fürst zu Fürstenberg in Donaueschingen at the time causing wider disregard for order among the public as it soon became apparently the Kaiser who had initially refused to take notice of the situation, only wanted to hear the viewpoint of the military. Even Chancellor Theobald von Bathmann Hollweg had been passed over the initial discussions.\n\nWhilst the event itself can be concluded the Reichstag is calling for a censure vote against Hollweg, and he would be due to give his first speech in the coming days. Should the Kaiser choose to intervene now it would in debt and secure Hollweg's chancellorship at the price of disregarding the rights of government."
 ww1_germany.196.oa:0 "The censure vote continues"

 ww1_germany.197.t:0 "The censure vote"
 ww1_germany.197.d:0 "As a consequence of the unfortunate Zabern events, the Reichstag called for a censure vote. Von Hollweg delivered his first speech his, to be crude, was a half-effort on his behalf. Hollweg supported the militaries actions and downplayed the event which did little to endear him to the Reichstag. However, in his second speech is can certainly be said he rallied more support among the Reichstag - keeping the points of his initial speech he did still alienate the SPD."

 ww1_germany.198.t:0 "The votes are in!"
 ww1_germany.198.d:0 "The vote was made, and the results made public, a defeat for Hollweg. The Reichstag declared the government 'not of the view of the Reichstag'. However, due to the constitution of Germany, this has had no forced effect of Hollweg's chancellery but with no direct support from the Kaiser and a weak political position is has been suggested that Hollweg should resign from his position as chancellor."

 ww1_germany.199.d:0 "The events of the past few weeks have finally been concluded, to little effect in the echelons of power, even if the left wing are less than appeased. Von Hollweg will now continue his work in the chancellery and the military believes their honour is intact. The Zabern affair will be remembered as a key event in the history of our ownership over Alsace Lorraine, and one can only hope soon the Alsatian people will soon accept their rightful German identity."

 ww1_germany.200.d:0 "Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg's chancellorship has officially ended as of 4:25 yesterday to the surprise of the Kaiser, and the hope of the Reichstag. His replacement has yet to be announced but Hollweg's resignation will surely mean his replacement candidate with come from one of the further left parties in order to ensure stability in the Reichstag. Ultimately, whilst restricted by reality and public opinion, it is the Kaiser's choice and soon the new chancellor will be announced."

Once the Kaiser had been made aware of the situation, he left his hunting event and immediately called for the punishment of the relevant officer. The Reichstag and the locals are pleased but unfortunately the Kaiser can't win on every front and the military do feel scored and dishonoured."

 ww1_germany.202.t:0 "A constitution for Alsace-Lorraine"
 ww1_germany.202.d:0 "Up until recently, the province of Elsaß-Lothringen had no constitution and was subject to direct Prussian administration. This situation has been, to the least, unsatisfactory for the local population and also helped preserve French animosity towards Germany, after the annexation of the province since our victory in the Franco-Prussian War. However, as of recently, sentiment has grown in favor of granting Alsace-Lorraine a constitution.n/n/Upon deliberation on the reform of the constitution for Alsace-Lorraine, the commission of the Reichstag has decided, with a majority of 17 votes, that Alsace-Lorraine is to form an autonomous federal state, and, with 28 votes to 4, that Alsace-Lorraine shall be represented in the Bundesrat with 3 votes. As to the shape this future federal state is to take in terms of state law, the Commission has decided so far that it shall be headed by a governor, who, at the recommendation of the Bundesrat, will be appointed for life by the Kaiser.n/n/These actions have been met with massively positive reception by the locals and soon they will no doubt class themselves are rightful German peoples."

 ww1_germany.204.d:0 "Yesterday, at 4:30pm CET, the foreign minister of Germany announced a new foreign policy aimed towards the improvement of Anglo-German relations and the enactment of measures to continue a naval balance of power. This announcement comes soon after the official dismissal of German admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and it is believed that the Kaiser himself aims to repair his family relation with his cousin King George V. \n \n Weather this effort will bear fruit is yet to be known but should Germany and the United Kingdom draw together, the power of Europe will forever be changed, and during such a time of mobilisation and nationalism, perhaps one day the United Kingdom and the German Empire will have to fight side by side."

 ww1_germany.205.d:0 "The period of hastened Détente between the United Kingdom, under his royal majesty king George V, and Germany, under Kaiser Wilhelm II, has accumulated to this moment, the pinnacle of the work of German and British foreign ministers. The photograph in the German newspapers on the morning of the Kaiser's return from his stay in London, picture him and his cousin sharing a ceremonial dinner in Buckingham palace - mimicking the newly formed friendship between the two Germanic nations. \n \n The state visit from the Kaiser symbolises a new European balance of power, reconciliations have been massively encouraged by both British parliament and the Reichstag."
